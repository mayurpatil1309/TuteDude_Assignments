first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

addition = first_number + second_number
subtraction = first_number - second_number
multiplication = first_number * second_number
division = first_number / second_number

print("Addition: ", addition)
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication)
print("Division: ", division)
